The workshop puts an emphasis on learning students basic web development with NextJS. Tasks vary from learning about page structure in NextJS, fetching data with REST from Bergen Bysykkel API, parsing and mapping data.

The workshop suits both beginners and more advanced students as it allows the more advanced students to expand upon the application how they please.
